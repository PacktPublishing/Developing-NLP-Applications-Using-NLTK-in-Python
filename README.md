## About the Video Course
	Have you ever faced challenges in understanding language and planning sentences while performing Natural Language Processing? Do you wish to overcome these problems and go beyond the basic techniques like bag-of-words?
Well, now you can. This course is designed with advanced solutions that will take you from newbie to pro in performing Natural Language Processing with NLTK. In this course, you will come across various concepts covering natural language understanding, Natural Language Processing, and syntactic analysis. 
It consists of everything you need to efficiently use NLTK to implement text classification, identify parts of speech, tag words, and more. You will also learn how to analyze sentence structures and master syntactic and semantic analysis.
By the end of this course, you will have all the knowledge you need to implement Natural Language Processing with Python.
